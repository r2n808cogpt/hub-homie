# 🧠 special-tribble — Service Factory Hub

This repo is the **central command node** for Xavier’s faceless service factory architecture — built for client delivery, agent orchestration, and tactical monetization. Every file, flow, and function in this repo is part of a ritualized pipeline designed to birth autonomous services from constraint.

---

## ⚙️ Core Purpose

To serve as the **hub** for spawning, mutating, and deploying client-facing services using agentic flows, shell scripts, and modular payloads — all executable from Termux, GitHub, or mobile shell environments.
