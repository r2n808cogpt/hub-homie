# Gemini Placeholder: Super Gem Style Tooling

This directory serves as a **safe, local placeholder** for advanced tooling interfaces, inspired by "super gem" style utilities.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE:**
This module is designed to define **interfaces and local logic only**. It is strictly prohibited from containing any direct external API integrations, especially to large language models or external services. All "reasoning" and "transformation" logic defined here must be local, deterministic, and subject to the `rsis808` safety checks.

The purpose of this folder is to provide a structured way to integrate complex, local processing steps (e.g., AST manipulation, advanced data transformation, complex reasoning flows) that are still fully controlled by the `safe-exec` and `rsis808` modules.

**No external APIs are to be called from this directory.**
